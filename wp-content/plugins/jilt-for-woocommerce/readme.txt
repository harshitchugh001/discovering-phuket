= When is a cart “abandoned”? =

A cart is considered abandoned if a customer has added items to the cart, but has not checked out or shown any cart activity for at least 15 minutes (ie adding more items). At this point, Jilt starts the timers for your recovery emails.

= Which customers will be emailed for abandoned carts? =

Any logged in customer who abandons a cart will receive recovery emails from Jilt. Any guest customer who has entered a full, valid email address in the checkout process will also be sent recovery emails.

= When will post-purchase emails be sent? =

Most post-purchase emails are triggered upon **order completion**, as this tells us your store is “done” with the order. Once an order is marked “completed”, Jilt will schedule post-purchase emails on the schedule you’ve configured in your automation. However, this can be customized to suit your needs.

= Can I include unique coupon codes in my emails? =

Yep! Jilt can automatically create unique coupon codes and include them in your automated emails. This gives you a proven and powerful means of increasing conversion rates and generating more orders!
